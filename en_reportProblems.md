# Reporting problems and issues #

## Preamble ##
Before creating and uploading a new version-package, I run hundreds of tests to ensure functionality and quality of Hyphenator.js
Nevertheless, there might be problems, errors and bugs that I don't see and that are nor revealed by my testsuite. Please don't hesitate to report these issues either by mail (mathias at mnn dot ch) or directly in the [issue-tracker](http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/issues/list).

Since I really want to solve the problem, it is very important to me, to get a good description of it. This page should help you to help me to (maybe help you  to;-) get it workin'.

Thanks for reading it!

## A bad description ##
_Hi, I updated to the new version. It does not work._

## A good description ##
  * Gives me an exact description of the problem (what do you see / see not, what happens / happens not, what is expected)
  * Tells me what **version** you where using before the error occurred.
  * Tells me in wich version the error occurred.
  * Tells me what **browser** or other environment with wich version on which system you where using (or simply: in all browsers)
  * Gives me a **link or a file**, where I can see and reproduce the problem live or on my system. A screenshot is fine, too but a html-page is highly preferred.

## How do I work, when I get a issue report? ##
First I try to reproduce the problem. You can save me a lot of time by providing a file or a link, where the problem occurs. Often I put it in the issue tracker (specially if I'm short on time).
Then I create a testcase to make shure that this problem stays solved, later.
Finally I try to fix it.
