# Hyphenator.js
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/hyphenator

I heard that Google Code would be dropped by Google in the near future, 
figured I'd "rescue" a favourite project by making a small backup of it.
Just in case the original author (Mathias Nater, I think?  Same as @mnater maybe?)
don't get a chance to do it.

All code belongs to the original author, I own nothing.
See `COPYING.txt` for details.
